# Introduction

This document provides a short introduction to the CIDSem specification set.

CIDSem is a context-to-triple extraction module that produces deterministic
256-bit `E` entities and triples ready for insertion into `cidstore`. The
specs in this directory present architecture, data models, extraction
algorithms, and integration patterns used by the project.
